<h2 class="hdings">Banff, Canada</h2>
<p class="info">Banff is easily my favorite place to visit, and the fact that it’s so close to Calgary makes it even better. It’s the perfect spot for a quick trip when you need to get away. There’s just so much to do! Hiking in the summer is amazing, with beautiful lakes and mountain views that honestly never get old... And in the winter, when its too cold to really do anything else, skiing is a must. Plus, the town itself is so cozy, with its historic shops and that classic mountain vibe. Every time I go, it feels like an escape thats much further than it really is.</p>

<h2 class="hdings">Puerto Vallarta, Mexico</h2>

<p class="info">Puerto Vallarta is my second favorite place to go, mainly because it’s such a fun spot to relax and soak up the sun. The beaches are beautiful, the weather is always warm, and there’s this lively, upbeat energy everywhere you go. Whether I’m chilling on the beach, wandering through the charming streets just outside of the resort, or taking a boat ride to hidden spots, there’s always something cool to do. And don’t even get me started on the food—it’s amazing. Every trip there feels like the perfect mix of relaxation and adventure.</p>

<h2 class="hdings">Lima, Peru</h2>
<p class="info">Lima has a special place in my heart because I lived there for three years when I was a kid, from first to third grade. It’s where a lot of my childhood memories come from, so going back always feels super nostalgic. I love walking along the Malecón by the ocean or exploring the old streets downtown, it’s like stepping into my past. And the food? Some of the best in the world. Every time I think of dishes like ceviche or lomo saltado, it brings me right back.</p>
